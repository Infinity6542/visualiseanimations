Visualise Animations is the uncreative name given to the project made to compare different CSS `animation-timing-function`s.

# Features and Technologies
The project supports up six different timing functions, including your favourite presets, such as `ease-in-out`, albeit in camelCase rather than kebab-case. It also supports cubic-beziers.

Additionally, the circles move in both directions, with a "shadow path" being drawn on the way back. The closer the shadow circles are, the faster the animation was during that particular part.

This project uses vanilla HTML, CSS and JS, with most animations being made with [Motion](https://motion.dev/).
