# Visualise Timings

## What is Visualise Timings?

Visualise Timings is the uncreative name given to the project made to compare different CSS `animation-timing-function`s.

## Why was it Made?

Visualise Timings was made to compare the different timing functions. It helps you visualise the differences and helps you choose the best one for your needs.

# Features and Technologies
The project supports up six different timing functions, including your favourite presets, such as `ease-in-out`, albeit in camelCase rather than kebab-case. It also supports cubic-beziers.
Each one of the six circles is colour-coded, allowing you to differentiate between them easily.
Additionally, the circles move in both directions, with a "shadow path" being drawn on the way back. The closer the shadow circles are, the faster the animation was during that particular part.

This project uses vanilla HTML, CSS and JS, with most Timings being made with [GSAP](https://gsap.com).
